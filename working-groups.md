## Background

In 2024 a core group of applicants gathered to write a proposal for a COST Action, which was subsequently awarded in 2025 and which officially started in November 2025. The [Memorandum of Understanding](https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA24161/mou/CA24161-e.pdf) (MoU) details the plans as set out at the start of the action. During the course of the action these plans will be implemented and updated.  

## Working Groups

The action is structured into several Working Groups, each focusing on specific research and coordination activities. These Working Groups ensure comprehensive coverage of our research objectives and facilitate effective collaboration. Each working group has a leader, a vice leader, and can consist of multiple task forces.

<div class="working-group">
  <h3>WP1: Quality Assessment and Quality Control</h3>
  <p>This Working Group focuses on improving the reliability and usability of neuroimaging data by developing shared standards and guidelines for quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC) across different imaging modalities, including MRI, MEG, EEG, and fNIRS. By bringing together experts and existing initiatives, WG1 aims to establish clear, transparent, and interoperable QA/QC practices that make it easier for researchers to evaluate data quality before use. These efforts will reduce duplication of work, enhance reproducibility, and support the use of neuroimaging data in advanced applications such as AI.</p>

    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Leader:</strong> Dr. Robert Oostenveld</p></td>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Co-leader:</strong> tba, TODO</p></td>
    </tr>

      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/avatar.jpg" width=120px></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="working-group">
  <h3>WP2: Metadata</h3>
  <p>WG2 is dedicated to improving the way neuroimaging data and experimental information are described and annotated. Metadata plays a crucial role in making data findable, interoperable, and reusable, but current practices are often inconsistent or incomplete. This Working Group will extend and refine existing standards, such as BIDS, and foster collaboration between metadata developers, software tool creators, and researchers. By improving metadata practices, WG2 will make it easier to discover, understand, and reuse neuroimaging datasets across research groups and disciplines.</p>

    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Leader:</strong> Dr. Lyuba Zehl</p></td>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Co-leader:</strong> tba, TODO</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/lyuba.jpg" width=120px></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/avatar.jpg" width=120px></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="working-group">
  <h3>WP3: Automated Preprocessing Pipelines</h3>
  <p>Preprocessing is a critical step in preparing neuroimaging data for analysis, but current practices are often ad hoc and poorly documented. WG3 aims to standardize and rationalize preprocessing procedures to enhance transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability. Focusing initially on EEG and MEG, this Working Group will define best practices and documentation standards for preprocessing pipelines, drawing on successful examples from MRI. The outcome will be clearer, more reusable pipelines that support consistent and trustworthy analyses across research sites.</p>
  <table style="width: 80%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Leader:</strong> Oscar Esteban (proposed, TODO)</p></td>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Co-leader:</strong> tba, TODO</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/oscar.jpg" width=120px></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/avatar.jpg" width=120px></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="working-group">
  <h3>WP4: Ethics, Practices, and Regulations</h3>
  <p>Sharing human neuroimaging data raises important ethical and legal questions, particularly regarding privacy and compliance with regulations such as the GDPR. WG4 will clarify and address these challenges by developing guidelines, tools, and training that help researchers navigate legal frameworks while maximizing the scientific and societal benefits of data sharing. It will also foster ethical discussions within the community, balancing openness and transparency with respect for participants’ rights and researchers’ concerns, ultimately supporting responsible and sustainable data sharing practices.</p>

    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;"><p><strong>Leader:</strong> Dr. Camille Maumet</p></td>

      <td><img src="/assets/images/profile/avatar.jpg" width=120px></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="working-group">
  <h3>WP5: Dissemination and Communication</h3>
  <p>WG5 ensures that the outcomes of the Action are visible, accessible, and impactful. This Working Group coordinates the communication and dissemination of guidelines, tools, training materials, and scientific results to the research community, stakeholders, and the public. By maintaining a strong online presence, engaging with key conferences and platforms, and supporting open access publication, WG5 plays a central role in building a vibrant network and encouraging the widespread adoption of the Action’s outputs across Europe and beyond.</p>

## Coordination and Management

All Working Groups are coordinated by the Action Chair and Vice Chair, with regular meetings to ensure alignment with the overall objectives of the COST Action. Annual progress reports and evaluation metrics are used to track achievements and adjust strategies as needed.
