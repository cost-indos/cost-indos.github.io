## 30 September 2025 - MC1 meeting

The first management committee (MC) meeting was hosted on 30 September 2025 at the COST headquarters in Brussels and attended by 21 members, representing 17 countries. The COST action was explained to all members by Wioleta Walentowska (Science Officer) and Flavya Ricci (Administrative Officer), including the networking tools and financial support. We discussed the initial actions to be undertaken by the working groups. Furthermore, the action chair, vice chair and others of the core team were selected and voted into position, and the budget for the first year was agreed upon.
