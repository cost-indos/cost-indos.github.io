<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>
Improving Neuroimaging Data for Sharing (INDoS) is a European COST Action (CA24161) dedicated to transforming how human neuroimaging data is shared, standardized, and reused. Neuroimaging methods like MRI, MEG, EEG, and fNIRS are essential for advancing brain research, but data sharing is often hindered by inconsistent quality standards, missing metadata, unclear legal frameworks, and non-standardized preprocessing. INDoS brings together experts from across Europe and beyond to address these four key challenges: quality assessment and control, metadata standardization, preprocessing pipelines, and ethical and legal guidelines. By strengthening collaboration between researchers, software developers, data stewards, and legal experts, the Action aims to make neuroimaging data more transparent, interoperable, and reusable.
</p>

<p>
Through coordinated networking, the Action will develop guidelines, tools, training materials, and best practices that support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) neuroimaging data sharing. It will build bridges between disciplines, foster a pan-European community, and train the next generation of researchers in open science practices. Ultimately, INDoS will enhance reproducibility, accelerate innovation—including AI applications—reduce research costs, and make neuroimaging research more inclusive and efficient across Europe and beyond.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
Our mission is to make neuroimaging data truly FAIR—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—by setting shared standards, tools, and ethical guidelines for data sharing. INDoS connects experts across Europe to improve data quality, transparency, and legal clarity, empowering researchers to share and reuse neuroimaging data efficiently and responsibly. Together, we’re building a more open, reproducible, and innovative future for brain research.
